\opening{Dear Diligence Team,}

	I started working with ConsenSys in May 2017, and since then, I've gained significant knowledge about the EVM and what makes it tick. Through my work with Alethio on the Ethereum Ontology, and through my own personal work on improving the Yellowpaper, I know more now than most people are prepared to talk about regarding the minutiae of all the interoperating parts that are working at the protocol level of Ethereum. 

	In the foggily determistic sets of interactions between \textit{high-level code} and \textit{low-level machine behavior}, no shortage of exploits are lurking. A good exploit will allow code to be used for a purpose other than the one for which it was intended. Such bugs are usually not written into the code because they generally occur merely as oversights on the part of the developer or auditor responsible. The only way to be certain about the bugs in a limitless variety of \textsl{abstract upper-level code} like Solidity code, is to intimately understand the limited and bounded nature of the machine operations which that code inevitably initiates and results in. 
	
	 Exploring tools and discovering their unintended uses is a natural disposition for me; so exploring smart contracts and finding their unintended uses also comes naturally to me, and doing it for the good of our ecosystem by improving safety and educating our users allows me to add value by building a more responsible smart sontract community at large. 

\closing{Yours in Blockchain,}

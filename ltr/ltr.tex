\opening {Dear Frontier Team,}

	I started working with ConsenSys in May 2017, and since then, I've gained significant knowledge about the EVM and what makes it tick. Through my work with Alethio on the Ethereum Ontology, and through my own personal work on improving the Yellowpaper and being a scribe in calls with many organizations planning to use Blockchain across the globe, I've become, (and am becoming,) increasingly aware of the ways that Blockchain, as a shared source of truth, can fundamentally change the world by incentivizing certain kinds of human behavior.

	One of the most interesting implications of this fact is that we  now have growing sets of empirically correct economic data. Every blockchain formed, like Bitcoin, through what I term as MLSC \textit{(massive, linear, sequential, consensus)}, and that fact alone ensures that most Blockchains are more correct than even the most stringent accountant's balance book.
	
	In order to properly evaluate the benefits and advantages of each system one must be able to trace the economic implications of specific laws, or rules, within a token's protocol. One must also be able to see these things in light of surrounding political economies and systems. Still other factors that can influence the price include competing tokens, consumer confidences/brand loyalty, and other general or specific market factors, plus company fundamentals. One must be unconventional enough to identify new models for understanding the value of certain tokens in light of the multitude of factors which surround their creation, distribution, and use.

\closing{Yours via Blockchain,}

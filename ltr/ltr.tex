\opening{Dear Diligence Team,}

	I started working with ConsenSys in May 2017, and since then, I've gained significant knowledge about the EVM and what makes it tick. Through my work with Alethio on the Ethereum Ontology, and through my own personal work on improving the Yellowpaper, I know more now than most people are prepared to talk about regarding the minutiae of interoperating parts working at the protocol level of Ethereum. 

	In the foggily determistic sets of interactions between \textit{high-level algebraic code} and \textit{low-level machine behavior}, apparently any amount of exploits may be lurking. A utilizable exploit will allow code to be used for purposes outside of its intended design. Probably the only way to be near-certain about the bugs in a potentially limitless variety of abstracted machine instructions in the form of \textit{upper-level code}, is to intimately understand the limited and bounded nature of the machine operations which that code inevitably initiates and results in. 
	
	 Exploring tools and discovering their unintended uses is a natural disposition for me; so exploring smart contracts and finding their unintended uses also comes naturally to me; and working as a part of a team that is actively engaged in finding such exploits and educating others on them may allow me to use that natural tendency for good. Perhaps, if conditions are favorable, we might join forces to improve the security of smart contracts together.

\closing{Yours via Blockchain,}
